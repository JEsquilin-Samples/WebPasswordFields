### How to see the password in a web password field.


Hi, my name is Jonathan and I am in middle school, this repository is a small "How to ..." project for my 8th grade English Class at American High Shcool.

The purpose of this repository is to create the files and technical instructions for someone to follow along with my "How to see the password in a web password field."
    
I know this is a very simple "How to" but I see it as an oportunity to learn how github works along the way to get my school project asignment done.  ;)
